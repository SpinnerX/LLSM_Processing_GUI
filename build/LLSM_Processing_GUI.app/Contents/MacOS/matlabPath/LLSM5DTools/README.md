LLSM5DTools

Tools for the analysis of 5D live images from lattice light-sheet microscopy (LLSM), including image deskew/rotation, Richardson-Lucy (RL) deconvolution, stitching, SIM reconstruction, point detection and point tracking, and some useful tools.

The point detection/tracking method is developed based on 

Aguet, F., Upadhyayula, S., Gaudin, R., Chou, Y.Y., Cocucci, E., He, K., Chen, B.C., Mosaliganti, K., Pasham, M., Skillern, W. and Legant, W.R., 2016. Membrane dynamics of dividing cells imaged by lattice light-sheet microscopy. Molecular biology of the cell, 27(22), pp.3418-3435.

The source code of the original package is at https://github.com/francois-a/llsmtools

Compared to the original method, we have several improvements, such as computing efficiency, scalability, detection in low SNR conditions, Gaussian mixture fitting, bug fixation and so on.
